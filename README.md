Papoose OSGi Log Service
=====
<em>An OSGi Log Service implementation.</em>

The Log Service provides a general purpose message logger for the OSGi Service
Platform. It consists of two services, one for logging information and
another for retrieving current or previously recorded log information.

Bundles can use the Log Service to log information for the Operator. Other
bundles, oriented toward management of the environment, can use the Log
Reader Service to retrieve Log Entry objects that were recorded recently or to
receive Log Entry objects as they are logged by other bundles.
